# Mask_Detector
* Detects if a person is wearing a mask in real time

* looking at alternatives for the second model (MTCNN) to increase the number of facial detections as well as to increase the accuracy

* YOLO implementation in the works to compare efficiency with two-stage model

* Currently in the process of deploying through AWS Lambda
